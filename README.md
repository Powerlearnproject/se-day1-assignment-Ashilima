Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering id the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. 
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce,entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming language such as C, Fortan
The establishment of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements
Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while the agile methodology is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collabartion, and responding to change. The waterfall methodology fcuses on the life cycle whilst agile focuses on an iterative and incremental approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testin code. Examples are Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
The Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples are Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines- This can be handled by effective communication and regular assessment of project goals and timelines
Changing requirements can be handled by effective communication and agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Testing individual components of modules of software
Integration- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System- Testing the entire software systems as a whole
Acceptance- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
Quality Control measures such as code reviews, automated tesing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
Learning how to be clear, specific and concise and adding context ensures that the Ai models can be more accurate in giving better answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example is, Teach me to budget. I would improve it by adding context for example, Let us say you are a student who has a weekly amount of x amount that should be used on y how can you budget the amount of money to spend it daily? 
The improved prompt is better as it provides the AI with a better opportunity to be of help.
